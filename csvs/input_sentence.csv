" Nuxt.js is a framework for creating Vue.js applications, you can choose between Universal, Static Generated or Single Page application (inspired by Next.js)"
"As a framework,  Nuxt.js comes with a lot of features to help you in your development between the client side and the server side such as Asynchronous Data, Middleware, Layouts, etc.  "
Nuxt.js includes the following to create a rich web application development: One of the main benefits is an easy to setup Server Side Rendering which improves Page performance and Search Engine Optimization.
Instead of rendering the content in the client Nuxt (Universal Mode) will send a Server Rendered File which reduces the load time and is way better for Search Engine Crawlers to detect.
Nuxt Generate provides a powerful tool to prerender pages but you can also use the SPA Mode.

 Markdown is a plain text formatting syntax designed so that  Markdown can be converted to HTML using a tool by the same name.
"Markdown is often used to format readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor."
"Markdown is a lightweight markup language, originally created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz, allowing people ¡°to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert  Markdown to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML)¡±."
The language takes many cues from existing conventions for marking up plain text in email.
"Markdown is also a Perl script written by John Gruber, ¡°Markdown.pl¡±, which converts marked-up text input to valid, well-formed XHTML or HTML and replaces left-pointing angle brackets (<) and ampersands with their corresponding character entity references."
"It can be used as a standalone script, as a plugin for Blosxom or Movable Type, or as a text filter for BBEdit."
"Markdown has since been re-implemented by others as a Perl module available on CPAN (Text::Markdown), and in a variety of other programming languages."
"Markdown is distributed under a BSD-style license and is included with, or available as a plugin for, several content-management systems."
"Different markdown dialects use slightly different formatting, but here are the general ideas: You can use"
You can use ``` to format entire code blocks (like the one below)
You can use > at the start of a line to insert a quote.
"A number of Markdown dialects are in widespread use, most of which add or enhance support for things like tables and links."
Notable examples include Babelmark may be used to compare the output generated by different implementations of Markdown.
"Since 2014, you also have CommonMark, a strongly defined, highly compatible specification of Markdown (see \"Standard Markdown is now Common Markdown\")."
" HTTP Request is a message within a request/response sequence, according to HTTP specification."

Previous versions of the language are currently relatively common.
Tcl is widely deployed (current patch version 8.5.18).
"As is Tcl 8.4 in more conservative deployments (8.4.20 is current, but end-of-lifed there)."
"Use of Tcl 8.4 or earlier is usually not recommended, as Use of Tcl 8.4 or earlier does not receive security-fix support from the Tcl developers."
You may write the language name as either TCL or Tcl; practitioners tend to prefer the latter on the grounds that it means practitioners don't have to hold the shift key down so long.

" A progress bar is a component in a graphical user interface used to convey the progress of a task, such as a download or file transfer."
"A progress bar is a component in a graphical user interface used to convey the progress of a task, such as a download or file transfer."
The graphic is often displayed as a bar which illustrates the task percentage complete.  
Descriptive textual information may accompany  A progress bar.
"Typically, determinate progress bars use a linear function, such that the advancement of a progress bar is directly proportional to the amount of work that has been completed."
"However, varying disk, memory, processor, bandwidth and other factors complicate this estimate."
"Consequently, progress bars often exhibit non-linear behaviors, such as acceleration, deceleration, and pauses."
"These behaviors, coupled with humans' non-linear perception of time passing, produces a variable perception of how long progress bars take to complete."
"However, this also means progress bars can be designed to \"feel\" faster."
"Finally, the graphical design of progress bars has also been shown to influence humans' perception of duration Indeterminate progress bars, on the other hand, provide a simple animation (often in the for of a spinning ring or an horglass). "

 Streaming is the process of delivering digital multimedia content from a provider to a consumer over a network.
a provider may have the data stored or may be relaying a provider from a live source.
"In computer science, streaming is the process of sending or receiving a sequence (stream) of data elements made available over time."
A stream can be thought of as a conveyor belt that allows items to be processed one at a time rather than in large batches which must be completed in whole before subsequent data transfer occurs.
"Streams are processed differently from batch data ¨C normal functions cannot operate on streams as a whole, as Streams have potentially unlimited data, streams are codata (potentially unlimited), not data (which is finite)."

 Focus indicates the component of the graphical user interface which is currently selected to receive input.  
Focus indicates the component of the graphical user interface which is currently selected to receive input.
Text entered at the keyboard or pasted from a clipboard is sent to the component which currently has the focus.
"Typically, the focus is withdrawn from an element by giving another element the focus."
The concept is similar to a cursor in a text-based environment.
"However, when considering a graphical interface, there is also a mouse cursor involved."
Moving a mouse cursor involved will typically move a mouse cursor involved without changing the focus.
the focus can usually be changed by clicking on a component that can receive focus with a mouse cursor involved.
Many desktops also allow the focus to be changed with the keyboard.
"By convention, the tab key is used to move the focus to the next focusable component and shift + tab to the previous one."
"When graphical interfaces were first introduced, many computers did not have mice, so this alternative was necessary."
This feature makes this alternative easier for people that have a hard time using a mouse to use the user interface.
"In certain circumstances, the arrow keys can also be used to move focus."
